# landing-page
This is supposed to be a personal landing page. However, so far it is full of placeholders and no real content.

I used my knowledge in flexbox and all the other web development techniques I learnt throughout The Odin Project.

The link to the landing page is https://flairseed.github.io/landing-page/
